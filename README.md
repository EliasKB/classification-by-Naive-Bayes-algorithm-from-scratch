# classification by Naive Bayes algorithm from scratch
## Assummtions: The BoW assumption e.g. the order of words in a doc doesn't matter
### some details: 
#### 1. Consider each review in a corpus (all_sentiment_shuffled.txt) as a document or doc.
#### 2. Each document is considered as a line.
#### 3. The reviews are already annotated with positive and negaive labels.
#### 4. The data is divided into training and evaluation/test data, 80% vs 20%.
#### 5. A model will be trained on training data and then will be evaluated on eval/test data.
#### Since we know already the true label of the reviews in the test data we can calcualte the accuracy by ration of right-classified reviews.
